Bennett here, I'm a biology-oriented person who is stumbling around with the tech world. Sooner or later I might actually learn something too ;) 

Ohh also, my favorite cat is the British Shorthair. 

Also to prove my fallibility, I just failed to title my file correctly, so when going through the github tutorial my issue didn't automatically close.
